He wants Jay to be a programmer becasue he thinks that programmer is easier to find a job in the future. However, Jay is not interested in this field. His father may need an enlighten game to spark Jay's interest. I think that the Google Dinosaur game is a best software for them. It is easy and funny. I am sure Jay would like it.

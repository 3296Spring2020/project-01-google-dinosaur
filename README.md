## Description
In this project, I want to create a browser extension which allows users to change the level of difficulty and allows users to attack barriers in the game based on the original game by using JavaScript. This extension will not only change the difficulties and allows user to attack, it also can be able to played while the internet connection is perfect. After the user turn on the extension on a blank page, the game will start.

## Project Relevance**
This project requires knowledge about JavaScript, CSS, GUI, and HTML, since the game itself is written in JavaScript, but the inspector will let user also view the code of webpage in CSS and HTML. This application is relating to our course including testing, debugging, solving program problems, and design patterns when we are trying to create objects in the game. For me, these goals are important since I want to become a game developer. Working with groups, design patterns, and knowing essential
and popular programming languages are the basic requirements for a game developer. This project, in my opinion, is interesting because it relates to what I want to do in the future, and I want to improve my skills and learn new things.

## Conceptual Design**
In order to make an extension, we just need to follow the steps which provide by google, and make sure we have everything. For change the level of difficulty, I am thinking of adding a factor variable which refers to level of difficulty. For example, if the user choose medium, refers to 2, and then the running speed and the number of objects will increased by 1.5. Attacking should be similar to jump. I can modified the code of jump and make it read attack button, like 'c', in the keyboard.

## Background**
URL reference: https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner/blob/gh-pages/README.md

This URL involves the original game code and many different versions of game, and it can be useful since we can actually learn from these code which lines change the character and how to add more objects.

Building:
Enable developer mode in the browser

Necessary things for creating the extension
Manifest file
Background Script
UI Elements
Content Scripts
jQuery
Testing:
Let people actually play the "modified version" of google dinosaur game!

Required Resources
This project will require for at least two people to working on.
Microsoft Studio or other IDE is needed for writing web languages.
It's better to have some knowledge about required programming languages or willing to learning them
